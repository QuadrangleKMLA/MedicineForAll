# MEDICINE FOR ALL - 2023 Capstone Project

## Goal & Purpose

Create a deep-learning medicine pill recognition model and create a mobile / web application that implements the model show the user with fundamental explanations on the detected medicine such as precautions to taking the medication and what medicines not to take together during the same period of time.

With the development of [Telemedicine](https://telehealth.hhs.gov/), following the COVID-triggered lockdown, many people take various types of medicine with less professional supervision as they get their medicine prescribed in large amounts. This would lead to patients overlapping various medications with less professional advice, which can lead to fatal results due to wrong combinations of medicine. Also, since most of the population that receives medication of high variety are the elderly or the ill, unsupervised intake of a variety of medicines can have an even higher fatality rate.

Through providing apparent yet fundamental information about the scanned medicine, we seek to serve even patients without expertise in the field of medicine from the dangers of false medicine intake.
